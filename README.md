# SCT_DS_3 – Bank Deposit Prediction Using Decision Tree
This repository shows my TASK-03 of "Data Science Internship" in "SkillCraft Technology" webpage (Mumbai, India). It focuses on predicting whether a bank customer will make a deposit using demographic and behavioral data with a Decision Tree classifier in Python (Jupyter Notebook).

# 📇 Project Overview
    • Dataset: bank.csv
    • Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
    • Focus Areas: Data Cleaning, Encoding, Train-Test Split, Decision Tree Modeling, Hyperparameter Tuning, Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC), Feature Importance, and Visualizations including Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Metrics Bar Charts

# ╰┈➤ 📝 Steps Breakdown
    • Explored and cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, verified data types, and encoded categorical variables.
    • Split dataset into training and testing sets.
    • Built and tuned a Decision Tree classifier using GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameters.
    • Evaluated the model with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and AUC.
    • Visualized results with a comprehensive 2×2 layout: Confusion Matrix, Metrics Bar Chart, Feature Importance, and ROC–AUC Curve.
    • Added a well-written insights section summarizing model performance, key predictors, and actionable interpretation.

# 🎯 Outcome
The project delivered a fully cleaned dataset, a tuned Decision Tree model, and a single comprehensive visualization capturing performance metrics, feature importance, and class separation. Insights highlight customer engagement features like call duration, month, and contact as most predictive for deposit behavior.

# 💡 Skills Gained
    • Data preprocessing & Encoding with Python
